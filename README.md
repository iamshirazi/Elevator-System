# Elevator-System

ReadMe File for SYSC3303 Winter 2021 Project. This project implements an elevator control system simulator using multi-threading, handling multiple elevators at once. The system configurations consists of the number of floors, the number of elevators, the time it takes to open and close the doors of the elevator, and the time it takes between each floor. A user interface will be provided to emulate the system to show the position of all of the elevators in the system at any given time.
